BasicCMS
========
BasicCMS is a very simple php based tool. I have tried to incorporate as many things as I could. More features are going to be added soon.

It provides a flexible user interface which lets you create, edit and delete your content. You need to go to your dashboard for getting started and start making your webpage !

It is really a basic version which needs many improvements but as of now I have uploaded the basic code with proper user management with sessions.

I have used Twitter bootstrap for the front end and core php is used as a back end technology.
