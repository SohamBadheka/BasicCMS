BasicCMS
========
Front End : Twitter Bootstrap
Back End : PHP

BasicCMS is a very simple php based tool. I have tried to incorporate as many things as I could. More features are going to be added soon.

It provides a flexible user interface which lets you create, edit and delete your content. You need to go to your dashboard for getting started and start making your webpage !

I have uploaded an SQL file for the database which is in MySQL. I have uploaded the basic code with user management with sessions.

I have used Twitter bootstrap for the front end and core php is used as a back end technology.
